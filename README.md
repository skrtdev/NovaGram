### Example
An example code of a simple bot.  
Works with both getUpdates and Webhooks
```php
use skrtdev\NovaGram\Bot;
use skrtdev\Telegram\Message;

$Bot = new Bot("YOUR_TOKEN");

$Bot->onMessage(function (Message $message) use ($Bot) {

    if(isset($message->text)){ // update is a message and has text
        $chat = $message->chat;
        $user = $message->from;
        $text = $message->text;

        if($text === "/start"){
            $message->reply("Hey! Nice to meet you. Use /info to know more about me.");
        }
        if($text === "/info"){
            $message->reply("Well, I'm just an example, but you can learn more about NovaGram at docs.novagram.ga");
        }
    }
});
```

## Features

- **Full**: All the Methods and Types implemented in Bot Api 5.0 (support **local Bot Api** too)  
- **Fast**: Support for JSON payload, and async handling of updates  
- **Extendable**: With [Prototypes](https://docs.novagram.ga/prototypes.html), you can add your custom functionalities  
- **Easy**: Exactly like original Bot Api, with many methods simplified in a very nice way  
- **Ready**: You can start creating your amazing bot right now, thanks to many Built-in features, such as [Conversations](https://docs.novagram.ga/database.html), [Entities Parser](https://docs.novagram.ga/objects.html) and [getDC](https://docs.novagram.ga/docs.html#getUsernameDC)  
- **Secure**: When using Webhooks, there is a Built-in Telegram IP Check, that works with Cloudflare too!  

### Why another PHP library?

I decided to build my own php library for telegram bot api because all the libraries i found on the web [made it difficult even to do the simplest things](docs/compare.md), such as a sendMessage.
NovaGram is built in order to bring a lightweight alternative to make bots, so that it is simple for beginners, but powerful for who already knows how to implement it.
